%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% FUNCTION
%  [ap,cp,mv,mc,iter,diffvec]=GMDAS(X,mv_ini,mc_ini,e,maxiter,sed)
% This function implements the GMDAS (Generalized Mixture Decomposition 
% Algorithmic Scheme) algorithm, where each cluster is characterized by 
% a Gaussian distribution. The aim is to estimate the means and the
% covariance matrices of the distributions characterizing each cluster,
% as well as the a priori probabilities of the clusters. This is carried
% out in an  iterative manner which terminates when no significant change
% in the values of the above parameters is encountered between two
% successive iterations. In contrast to the k-means and the k-medoids
% algorithms, each vector belongs to a cluster with some probability.
% The number of clusters m is assumed to be known. 
%
% INPUT ARGUMENTS:
%  X:       lxN matrix, each column of which corresponds to
%           an l-dimensional data vector.
%  mv_ini:  lxm matrix, each column of which contains an
%           initial estimate of the means that correspond to the clusters.
%  mc_ini:  lxlxm matrix whose j-th lxl two-dimensional
%           "slice" is an initial estimate of the covariance matrix
%           corresponding to the j-th cluster.
%  e:       threshold that is involved in the terminating condition of
%           the algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm terminates when the
%           sum of the absolute differences of mv's, mc's and a priori
%           probabilities between two successive iterations is smaller than
%           e. 
%  maxiter: maximum number of iterations the algorithm is allowed to
%           run. 
%  sed:     seed used for the initialization of the random generator
%           function "rand".
%
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
%  ap:      m-dimensional vector whose i-th coordinate contains the a
%           priori probability of the i-th cluster.
%  cp:      Nxm matrix whose (i,j) element contains the
%           probability of the fact that the i-th vector belongs to the
%           j-th cluster. 
%  mv:      lxm matrix each column of which contains the
%           final estimate of the means that correspond to the clusters.
%  mc:      lxlxm dimensional matrix whose j-th lxl two-dimensional
%           "slice" is the final estimate of the covariance matrix
%           corresponding to the j-th cluster.
%  iter:    number of iterations performed by the algorithm.
%  diffvec: a vector whose i-th cooordinate contains the difference
%           between the sum of the absolute differences of "mv"'s "mc"'s and a 
%           priori probabilities between the i-th and the (i-1)-th iteration.
