# Clustering on Hyperspectral Image
Project for "Clustering" Master course of Data Science and Information Technologies (DSIT)

## Description of Project
This project is devoted to Hyperspectral Images (HSI) processing.

The goal is compare the performance of cost function optimization clustering algorithms on the one hand and the hierarchical algorithms on the other hand, in finding homogeneous regions in the
Salinas HSI
